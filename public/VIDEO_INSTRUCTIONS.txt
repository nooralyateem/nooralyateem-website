📹 VIDEO BACKGROUND INSTRUCTIONS
================================

Please add your background video to this folder (public/):

Required File:
- hero-video.mp4
  - Used as: Background video for the hero section
  - Recommended specifications:
    * Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
    * Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
    * Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)

Video Requirements:
- Format: MP4 (most compatible)
- Name must match exactly: hero-video.mp4 (case-sensitive)

Tips for Best Results:
1. Use bright, warm-toned footage that works with cream overlay
2. Avoid busy or distracting backgrounds
3. Choose footage with slower movement for better text readability
4. Test with the 70% cream overlay to ensure text is readable

Alternative Formats (optional):
- You can also provide .webm format for better compression
- Add as: hero-video.webm

After adding the video:
1. Save the file in this public/ folder
2. Refresh your browser (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. The video should start playing automatically in the background

Note: If no video is added, the section will display with the cream background color as a fallback.
